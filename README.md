## A lightning description of GB domestic energy supply, end-to-end

To understand what I want to sketch out for EV charging, it helps to understand its inspiration, supply to domestic households.

First a disclaimer - there are probably details that I've got wrong. Either I've simplified to the point of inaccuracy, or I've just plain got it wrong.
That's OK, the intention is just to explain the principles.

The actors in the end-to-end supply are:

#### Generation companies

These are the companies turning fuel or renewable resources into power. They own nuclear power stations, fossil fuel power stations,
windmills, solar farms, hydroelectric facilities, even battery farms. Anything that puts power on the grid. In principle anyone could set up such a company
and start supplying power to the grid.

#### Transmission and distribution companies

These are the companies that run the wires and facilities that carry power from where it's generated, to where it's consumed.
For simplicity I'm treating this as one unit, although in reality "transmission" is the big national-scale bit, and "distribution" is the local bit.

The distributor owns the wire going into your meter, and the meter itself.



#### Suppliers

An electricity "supplier" is the company you're most aware of as a consumer. They're the ones that retail to consumers, the ones with consumer tariffs,
the ones you switch between in search of better deals, who bill you, accept payments, maintain a credit account and so on.

Suppliers don't own the meter, but they're often responsible for organising fitting, maintenance, tamper-proofing and so on. 

#### Consumers

In short, householders. The person who uses the electricity and ultimately pays for it.

Consumers own everything on the output side of the meter - including the consumer unit ("fuse box"), and all the wires and sockets hanging off it. They
have a contract with the supplier, who bills them and gets paid (the payment mechanism is irrelevant, but you know the typical arrangements already).
